// Write your code here

class Breakfast{
  constructor(food,drink){
this.food=food;
this.drink=drink;
  }
}

class Lunch{
    constructor(salad,soup,drink){
this.salad=salad;
this.soup=soup;
this.drink=drink;
  }
}


class Dinner{
      constructor(salad,soup,entree,dessert){
this.salad=salad;
this.soup=soup;
this.entree=entree;
  }
}



3. Create a class for `Dinner`. Since dinner is a little bit fancier, `Dinner` will have a constructor with salad, soup, entree, and dessert. Indicate that dessert is intended to be a private property by including an underscore (`_`) at the beginning.
